# Ray-Tracing
Computer Architecture project

Automatically made HARDWARE/ (simulation, db, incremental_db)

The project focused on running ray tracing graphics on a Cyclone III FPGA, developed using Quartus 13.1. It involved designing a custom picoRISC CPU based on RISC-V, which executed assembler code with a custom instruction set. The system included a GPU for VGA output, SDRAM communication module (within the GPU), and a PS/2 keyboard controller.
